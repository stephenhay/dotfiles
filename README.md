# dotfiles

A copy of (some of)  my dotfiles. I spend most of my time doing actual work, not tweaking dotfiles for mass consumption and dotfile beauty pageants.

In other words, don't just copy these and use them, because that's not what they're for. If you want batteries included, then something like Mathias Bynens' dotfiles (https://mths.be/dotfiles) is probably better for you. 

That said, if you know what you're doing, there may or may not be little interesting bits in here somewhere.
